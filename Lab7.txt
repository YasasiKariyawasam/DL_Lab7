1. Model-Based Algorithms:

These algorithms learn or use a model of the environmentâ€”specifically, the state transition probabilities and reward function.

They can simulate future states to plan the best actions.

Example: Value Iteration or Policy Iteration in a Markov Decision Process (MDP).

Pros: Can plan ahead, adapt quickly to changes.

Cons: Requires knowledge of the environment or needs to learn the model, which can be complex.

2. Model-Free Algorithms:

These algorithms do not learn a model of the environment. Instead, they learn the value of actions or policies directly through experience.

Example: Q-Learning and SARSA.

Pros: Simpler, can work in unknown environments.

Cons: Usually needs lots of trial-and-error experience, slower to adapt.
